This project contains the backend applications for registration, login, change password,  and reset password authentication using python framework, Django. <br>

User can create an account using the register page <br>
Login <br>
Change Password <br>
Use the forgot password with an email authentication <br>

NB: The forgot password for this project won't work fine yet until the smtp configuration is setup in the project, settings.py file.
I have written the configuration out, you can go the settings.py to input the email and password.
