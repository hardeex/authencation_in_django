This project contains the backend applications for registration, login, change password,  and reset password authentication using python framework, Django. 

User can create an account using the register page
Login 
Change Password
Use the forgot password with an email authentication

NB: The forgot password for this project won't work fine yet until the smtp configuration is setup in the project, settings.py file.
I have written the configuration out, you can go the settings.py to input the email and password.
